📊 Credit & Debit Banking Data Analytics
🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze credit and debit banking transactions to:
Detect fraudulent and abnormal activities
Identify high-risk transactions across banks and branches
Evaluate customer transaction behavior
Monitor overall account activity and payment method trends
This analysis supports risk management, compliance monitoring, and strategic decision-making for banking operations.

💡 Solution Overview

An interactive analytics solution was developed using Power BI and Tableau to provide a comprehensive view of:
Fraud and high-risk transaction patterns
Bank-wise and branch-wise transaction performance
Customer-level transaction concentration
Credit vs debit behavior and transaction method distribution
The dashboards enable stakeholders to quickly identify anomalies and monitor financial activity efficiently.

⚙️ Approach & Methodology

Data Understanding & Preparation
Analyzed transactional datasets covering credit, debit, and bank transfer activities
Cleaned, validated, and standardized data for accuracy and consistency

Data Modeling

Built relationships between customers, banks, branches, and transactions
Created calculated fields and measures for risk metrics and ratios

KPI & Metric Development
High Risk Count & Suspicious Flag Count
Credit-to-Debit Ratio
Account Activity Ratio
Transaction Amount & Volume by Bank, Branch, and Time

Dashboard Development
Fraud & Abnormal Activity Dashboard
Customer & Branch Activity Metrics Dashboard
Implemented filters for bank, branch, transaction type, and description

Visualization & Analysis
Time-series trend analysis
Bank and branch comparison views
Customer ranking and transaction method distribution

📊 Key Insights & Findings

Approximately 20.5% of transactions are classified as high risk
Debit Cards, Credit Cards, and Bank Transfers contribute almost equally (~33% each) to total transactions
Specific banks and branches consistently show higher suspicious activity, indicating potential risk concentration
Monthly transaction trends remain stable for most of the year, with a significant decline in November
A small segment of customers accounts for a large share of total transaction value, highlighting concentration risk
A credit-to-debit ratio of ~0.99 indicates balanced inflow and outflow across accounts
